            <p class = "libraryCardInformation">Cards will be issued in person to any resident of New York State who can provide two forms of identification, one of which includes your current address. Valid forms of identification include a driver’s license or a state issued non-drivers ID with your current address, an ID card or badge with your name typed (NOT written) on it, mail with your name and current address printed on it and a postmark within the past 30 days.

                If you do not have these forms of ID please check at the Check Out desk to see what else you can use. If necessary a postcard can be sent to your address for verification.
