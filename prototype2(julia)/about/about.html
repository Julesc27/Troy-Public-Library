                <p><strong>Troy Public Library</strong> has been a cornerstone of our community since 1799, making it one of the oldest cultural institutions in Troy, New York.</p>
                
                <p>The library was chartered in 1905 to serve the City of Troy after the union of the Troy Lending Library, the Troy Young Men's Association, and the Free Reading Room of Troy. Since 1897, the library's home has been the magnificent Hart Memorial Building on Second Street in historic downtown Troy.</p>
                
                <p>As a special district library established by New York State in 2010, we proudly serve the Troy community with two locations, extensive collections, innovative programming, and a commitment to free and open access to information for all.</p>
